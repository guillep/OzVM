BUILDING FROM JENKINS SOURCES
=============================

If you downloaded the sources from the hudson(or jenkins) server use cmake 
to build the VM.

    cd build
    cmake .
    make

DO NOT USE scripts in unixbuild or macbuild or cygwinbuild for building VMs. 
There is no any guarantees that they are working for sources taken from git 
repositories!


(RE)CREATING THE GENERATED VM SOURCES
=====================================
If you downloaded the sources from gitorious do the following the VM sources
are not included (unlike the jenkins build download). The following steps
explain how to generate the VM sources from a build image.

- get a fresh pharo image from the build server:
  Either run the script in the image folder

    cd image
    ./newImage
 
  or get the vmmaker image from jenkins manually

    https://ci.lille.inria.fr/pharo/view/VM-dev/job/Cog%20Git%20Tracker%20(cog-osx)/ws/vmmaker-image.zip


- load VMmaker in the pharo image
    
    cd image
    # directly evaluate the contents of ConfigurationOfCog.st
    pharo $PWD/Pharo14.image $PWD/ConfigurationOfCog.st

    # alternatively copy the contents of ConfigurationOfCog.st into a new
    # workspace and evaluate it


- generate the source from a given VM configuration, evaluate the following in
  the workspace (for ex. CogUnixConfig or CogMsWindowsConfig):

    MTCocoaIOSCogJitConfig generateWithSources.

  See the ConfigurationOfCog.st for more examples for the common platforms.

   
- once the sources are exported you can launch cmake and build the VM 

    UNIX:
        using Unix Makefiles
    
        cd build
        cmake .             # this is the same as cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"
        make

    OSX:
        cd build
        export CC='/usr/bin/gcc-4.2'    # as of 10.7 llvm is the incompatible
                                        # default compiler
        export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.5
        cmake .
        make
    
    Varia:

        Consult the last section from `cmake --help` to check for other generators.
        For instance to create an XCode project under OSX do the following

          cd build
          rm -f CMakeCache.txt   # remove existing cache to avoid issues
          export CC='gcc-4.2';   # make sure we don't use llvm
          cmake -G "Xcode"
          open CogVM.xcodeproj


- run the freshly compiled VM from 'results'
