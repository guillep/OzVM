If you downloaded source from hudson(or jenkins) server,
please use cmake for building VM.

i.e.:

cd build
cmake .
make

DO NOT USE scripts in unixbuild or macbuild or cygwinbuild for building VMs. There is no any guarantees that they are working
for sources taken from git repositories!

See a complete guide how to build Cog VM using cmake on:
http://code.google.com/p/cog/wiki/Guide
