BUILDING FROM JENKINS SOURCES
=============================

If you downloaded the sources from the hudson(or jenkins) server use cmake 
to build the VM.

    cd build
    cmake .
    make

DO NOT USE scripts in unixbuild or macbuild or cygwinbuild for building VMs. 
There is no any guarantees that they are working for sources taken from git 
repositories!


(RE)CREATING THE GENERATED VM SOURCES
=====================================
If you downloaded the sources from gitorious do the following the VM sources
are not included (unlike the jenkins build download). The following steps
explain how to generate the VM sources from a build image.

- get a fresh pharo image from the build server:

    cd image
    ./newImage

- load VMmaker in the pharo image
    
    cd image
    # directly evaluate the contents of ConfigurationOfCog.st
    pharo $PWD/Pharo14.image $PWD/ConfigurationOfCog.st

    # alternatively copy the contents of ConfigurationOfCog.st into the
    # workspace and evaluate it


- generate the source from a given VM configuration, evaluate the following in
  the workspace (for ex. CogUnixConfig or CogMsWindowsConfig):

    MTCocoaIOSCogJitConfig generateWithSources.

   
- once the sources are exported you can launch cmake and build the VM
    
    cd build
    cmake .
    make
